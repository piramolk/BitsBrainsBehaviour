# BitsBrainsBehaviour
Module taken in Autumn Term 2019. 

## Bits, Brains and Behaviour Module Description:
The course provides both basic and advanced knowledge in reinforcement learning across three core skills: theory, implementation, and evaluation and the underling biology. Students will learn the fundamentals of both tabular reinforcement learning and bio-inspired learning, and will gain experience in designing and implementing these methods for practical applications.


## Module syllabus
The course will include:

- Introduction to Reinforcement Learning and its Mathematical and Biological Foundations

- The Markov Decision Process Framework

- Markov Reward Processes

- The Policy

- Markov Decision Processes

- Dynamic Programming

- Model-Free Learning & Control

- Monte-Carlo Learning 

- Temporal Difference Learning

- Biological and psychological principles of reward processing and generation of behaviour.

- Practical examples of reinforcement learning principles and generalisation to more complex settings such as robot control.

Reinforcement learning has a strong practical element and is best appreciated through implementation and evaluation.
